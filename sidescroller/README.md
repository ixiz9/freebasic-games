A simple sidescroller game inspired by the likes of Defender.

To build on linux just do:
```
fbc sidesc.bas
```

Sound requires SDL2. On Linux you should install `libsdl2-dev` and `libsdl2-mixer-dev`. On windows you should 
download the SDL2 DLLs from [github](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.26.2) and put them in the same directory as this source.
